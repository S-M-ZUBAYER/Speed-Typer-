                <p>
                    The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are known as global variables and
                    have global scope. Global scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part of that
                    program, any function or conditional state can access that variable.
                </p>
                <h4 class="text-info">Local Scope:-</h4>
                <p>
                    If you were to define some variables inside curly brackets {} or inside a specific function then
                    those variables are called local variables The local variables have a very confined scope which is
                    called the local scope But, with the release of ES6, the local scope was further broken down into
                    two different scopes:

        <h3>3. Functional process of Event loop in JavaScript?</h3>

            <div class="col-sm-12 col-lg-8 ">
                <h4 class="text-info">Functional process of event loop:-</h4>
                <p>
                    Back to our timeout example, once the Web API finishes executing the task, it doesn’t just push it
                    back to the Call Stack automatically. It goes to the Task Queue. <br>
                    A queue is a data structure that works on the First in First out principle, so as tasks get pushed
                    into the queue, they get out in that same order. Tasks that have been executed by the Web API’s,
                    which are being pushed to the Task Queue, then go back to the Call Stack to get their result printed
                    out. <br>
                    The event loop is a process that waits for the Call Stack to be clear before pushing callbacks from
                    the Task Queue to the Call Stack. Once the Stack is clear, the event loop triggers and checks the
                    Task Queue for available callbacks. If there are any, it pushes it to the Call Stack, waits for the
                    Call Stack to be clear again, and repeats the same process.

                    3. as a function parameter if we forgot to passed any argument that will show us undefined. <br>
